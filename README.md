### WD4E Capstone - Home Renovation Website model
----

This is a webpage I developed that could be used by a building contractor business, interior designer, or by an owner to share photos and information about a renovation project.

#### Background:

I originally developed a personal website targeted towards my family and friends with the intent to share information about a remodeling project that is underway at my family’s vacation home. This repository contains a more genericized version of of my webpage that could be used as a  webpage template by a construction or design consulting company to share construction project information with a client. Or, it could be used as a template to a personal webpage to share information with family and friends about a home renovation project.

The website template consists of a home landing page that shares general information about a house and the general plans of a multi-year remodeling project. There are three linked pages: A design page that reveals the more detailed design plans, a progress page that explains the construction work as it progresses, and a calendar page that includes the construction schedule.

#### Technical Overview

The website template was written with the Bootstrap v4 framework.  The website passed the W3 Validator and passed the WAVE Validator with the exception of one minor error related to the Bootstrap 4 Navbar - specifically, the toggler button that was used in the template being empty. The website was developed for small devices first, and is responsive as the layout changes for small, medium, large and extra-large devices.

#### Layout Overview

1. At the top of each page in the template is an expandable, sticky navigation bar with the recognizable Bootstrap hamburger icon.
2. Below the navbar is a photo carousel of home and property photos both current and vintage. This is actually a responsive multi-image carousel.
3. At the bottom of the page is footer information consisting of links to construction contractors and sub-contractors, an embedded Google map applet of the area, and an embedded weather widget from WeatherWidget-IO.
4. On the “Progress” page, I used Bootstrap 4 cards with Lightbox functionality. For example, as you go into the Kitchen section of the progress page there are two sets of responsive card groups, and the photos within these two card groups create a nice lightbox with the ability to carousel through all the photos in the Kitchen section. I find that this is an especially helpful feature to access the progress photos on a medium device like an IPad Pro. It less helpful but not without merit on smaller and larger devices.

#### Styling

The template uses subtle, understated styling choices that organizes the content, makes the content more accessible, and does not overwhelm the audience. On the last point, I designed a very understated presentation because the audience includes homeowners and family members who may be feeling a mixture of emotions about the construction and renovation project at hand. Recognizing the homeowners frame of mind, the design purposefully uses more subdued styling choices.

#### Typography

I used Google's “Arizonia” font for my Navbar brand and H1 headings. I used Perpetua font for H2-H6 headings. This is consistent with the subdued styling choices mentioned above.
