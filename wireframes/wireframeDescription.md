I will develop a home renovation webpage that will have a home page as well as three additional webpages that show the design, progress and calendar of the remodeling work. The page could be used by a building contractor business or by an owner to share photos and information about their renovation project.

The file `renoModelWireframe` in this directory contains images of my paper and pencil wireframes. Here is an explanation of each page:

- Page 1: Home Page with small screen view
- Page 2: Home Page – medium and large screen
- Page 3: Home Page – extra-large screen
- Page 4: Design Page with small screen view
- Page 5: Design Page – medium and large screen
- Page 6-7: Design Page – extra-large screen
- Page 8: Progress Page with small screen view
- Page 9-10: Progress Page – medium and large screen
- Page 11-12: Progress Page – extra-large screen
- Page 13: Calendar Page – Medium and Large Screens

I have not yet sketched a calendar page wireframe for small screens because I am not sure what calendar plug-in and form functionality will be appropriate on a phone or anything less than a medium-sized device like an  iPad or other tablet.
